    <h2>About us...</h2>
    <p>
        At DS Workshop we are primarily Citroen DS enthusiasts, But we
        are by no means limited to D models, we are happy to work on the
        whole classic Citroen family.<br/>
        We have a busy workshop where we can sort out everything from
        simply changing a light bulb and MOT to undertaking full
        restoration and engine rebuilds.<br/>
        We are dedicated to supplying the best possible parts and after
        encountering problems with other parts on the market we have
        developed and invested in our own range including front
        suspension arms and pistons and liners.
