    <p><b>1966 DS21 semi auto Pallas</b> - <i>Â£25500</i> -
        <a href="mailto:info@dsworkshop.co.uk?subject=1966 DS21 Sales Enquiry">Enquiries</a><br/>
        Selling on behalf of customer.<br/>
        Right hand drive. Gris Palladium, blue leather interior with Webasto sunroof.<br/>
        Incredibly rare being one of the last top spec Citroen DS's built at the British slough factory
        before RHD production moved to Paris. Differences include Lucas lights, Smiths dials &amp; the blue
        leather interior, French built cars only had tabac, brown &amp; black leather options. Also vertical
        front number plate holder fitted for the British market. Hidden rear demist & heating for the rear.<br/>
        <br/>
        Older restoration, recent bills include complete engine rebuild last year with new pistons, liners,
        timing chain etc. Drives beautifully and is lovely and quiet in comparison to most. The original
        leather interior is however getting past its best, it is 50+ years old and has been used as a family
        car for the last 7.<br/>
        The car is sold as is (once it's had a service and a good once over) but the price can be adjusted
        to include a new leather upholstery.
